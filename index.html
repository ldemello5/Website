              <br><br>
              My 2B term project was a prosthetic device that used forearm EMG signals to actuate movement and twist a doorknob. 
              The EMG signal was collected from electrodes on the user's forearm, and was then put through a custom circuit 
              consisting of an instrumentation amp, bandpass filter, buffer, and integrator. It was then processed by an Arduino, 
              which actuated servo motion to clamp the doorknob. 
              <br><br> The design was created in Solidworks and variables including 
              vertical printing, adjustability, printing time/costs, material, infill, tolerancing and anthropomorphic data were all 
              considered. An FEA was conducted to ensure the print would be structurally stable and functional.</p>

          <p>This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in design/CAD, and Solidworks.
            <br><br>
            I’ve always had a fascination with military history and technological advancements, particularly with aircraft. 
            The evolution of fighters like the SBD Dauntless, Zeroes, or Stuka dive bombers from WW2 all the way up to our current fifth-gen fighters 
            like the F35 Lightning II is super interesting. With a desire to model a fighter jet, I wanted to select a lesser-known aircraft that is 
            still very important in today’s geopolitical atmosphere. The Dassault Rafale was manufactured by Dassault Aviation in France, and has seen 
            action in Afghanistan, Mali, Libya, Iraq and Syria. Being employed by countries like Egypt, Qatar, and India, these fighters play crucial roles 
            in the balance of power of various nations in the Middle East and south Asia. 
          <!-- <br><br>
          I designed this jet in Solidworks using a variety of features including planes, boundaries, mirrors, extrudes, cuts, fillets, 
          lofts, sweeps, split lines, revolves, and circular patterns. -->

            <br><br>
            While working in the Brady Lab at UC Davis, I was tasked with creating this pipeline. The goal of the research is 
            to determine factors in sorghum roots that prevent Striga hermonithica from forming a xylem bridge post-attachment, 
            for example, amount of aerenchyma, suberin concentration, and lignin concentration. Gathering this information by hand from root 
            cross-sections I imaged with a Cytation C10 Confocal Microscope is very time-consuming, which is where the pipeline comes in. 
            I annotated hundreds of cross-sections to train the Yolov8 model to 
            to isolate the endodermis, and then I used HSV and grayscale to determine the brightness of fluoral yellow in the endodermis, which 
            indicates suberin concentration.

            While the assignment was only for the Mealy FSM portion, I wanted to up it a notch. This "incubator" and its circuitry was 
            soldered, assembled, and painted by hand, and provided a nice creative outlet during my term. The Arduino operated on a 227-line program I wrote. 
            This was my first time using concurrent task management to keep the timing of several lights consistent in the void loop function, and used 
            real-time programming techniques like hardware interrupts, timer use, and event-driven programming. I heavily used functions to keep the code organized 
            and simplified, resulting in just 5 lines of code in the void loop function.

            <p>These projects allowed me to strengthen my skills in game development, 
              object-oriented programming (C#), and problem-solving within the Unity environment/Windows CMD.
              <br>
              For the KuriusHacks Christmas Edition Game Jam 2021, I worked with my group to create an original game in Unity with C# scripts that 
              included a game menu, options page with adjustable volume, player controls and movement, collision detection, character-activated movement, 
              and sound effects. 

              I also recreated the classic Space Invaders game in Unity with C# scripts. This project involved designing 
              and implementing gameplay mechanics, including enemy behavior, player controls, collision detection, animations, sound effects, 
              and scoring systems. 

              Lastly, I programmed the classic game Othello to run on Windows CMD using C# scripts. The game includes custom names, a custom board size, 
              a scoring system, and the standard game mechanics.

              During my time at OES working as a Mechanical Design Associate, I designed scoreboards for a variety of sports including 
              football, basketball, and hockey. After creating individual sheet metal components in Inventor, I used them to create cabinets in 
              assemblies with other parts like wiring, power boxes, digits, fans, plates, and a variety of screws and nuts. I then assembled the 
              cabinets in a larger assembly with more screws, nuts, and mounting gear. All parts were mated appropriately. Following this, I created 
              detailed engineering drawings for each individual part for fabrication, and compiled BoMs.

                time in a real brass band. I had lots of fun! This was near Christmas time, and the flugel player was awesome to hear.

              <p class="card-text">While playing with the St. Andrew's College Wind Ensemble, my favorite piece was Red Rock Mountain. I tried to learn the trumpet, 
                sax, euphonium, flute, clarinet and trombone parts to combine into a trombone-only version. I was 17 at the time, and this was by far the most 
                ambitious music project I had undertaken. Looking back, it could have been worse lol.
